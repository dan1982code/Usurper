  crlf;
  d(5,'The Alchemist');
  d(config.textcolor,'This character depends greatly on his ability to use poisons. His');
  d(config.textcolor,'skills enable him to apply powerful poison');
  d(config.textcolor,'to his weapons. Without that aid, the alchemist');
  d(config.textcolor,'leaves much to be desired as far as natural fighting skills is');
  d(config.textcolor,'concerned. Being a creature of science, this class');
  d(config.textcolor,'cannot use any magical powers or wands. The alchemist may,');
  d(config.textcolor,'however, resist the effects of a spell or magical device.');
  d(config.textcolor,'Alchemists receive an extra bonus in Wisdom per experience');
  d(config.textcolor,'level.');
  d(config.textcolor,'Alchemists have their own Order, in which they can excell in');
  d(config.textcolor,'their profession and also get more powerful.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Assassin');
  d(config.textcolor,'A Ninja-style fighter, the assassin has extra fighting ability');
  d(config.textcolor,'making him tough to defeat. With the use of');
  d(config.textcolor,'backstabs, the assassin will usually have enough firepower to');
  d(config.textcolor,'defeat any fighting class. Assassins receive an extra bonus in');
  d(config.textcolor,'Agility per experience level.');
  pause;
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Barbarian');
  d(config.textcolor,'The strongest combat-class fighter in the game, but the most');
  d(config.textcolor,'susceptible to the effects of magic. As the Barbarian grows in');
  d(config.textcolor,'experience, his hitting power augments. There will be a point');
  d(config.textcolor,'where a Barbarians essence can match the power of any man-made');
  d(config.textcolor,'weapon. Barbarians receive an extra bonus in Stamina per');
  d(config.textcolor,'experience level.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Bard');
  d(config.textcolor,'The Bard-class enjoys every aspect of the game: backstabbing');
  d(config.textcolor,'magic, stealing, and fighting. However, the bard does not');
  d(config.textcolor,'specialize in any of his abilities, thus his experience can be');
  d(config.textcolor,'either rewarding or frustrating. An entertainer by trade, Bards');
  d(config.textcolor,'receive an extra bonus in Charisma per experience level.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Cleric');
  d(config.textcolor,'A Cleric has good combat and magic abilities. His ability to');
  d(config.textcolor,'Heal is stronger than his ability to Blast. Clerics get to use');
  d(config.textcolor,'poisons cheaply, but not too effectively. Clerics receive an');
  d(config.textcolor,'extra bonus in Charisma per experience level.');
  pause;
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Jester');
  d(config.textcolor,'Jesters are annoying pests. They lack serious hand-to-hand');
  d(config.textcolor,'combat power, but their acrobatic-like abilities gives them an edge');
  d(config.textcolor,'in dodging attacks. Jesters also possess some magic,');
  d(config.textcolor,'backstabbing, and thieving abilities. Jesters receive an extra');
  d(config.textcolor,'bonus in Charisma per experience level.');
  crlf;
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Magician');
  d(config.textcolor,'The Magician is the opposite of the Fighter; powerful magic');
  d(config.textcolor,'opposed to combat abilities. Magicians can consistently cast');
  d(config.textcolor,'spells effectively and yield better results. Magicians receive');
  d(config.textcolor,'an extra bonus in Wisdom per experience level.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Paladin');
  d(config.textcolor,'Paldins are characters with strong beliefs and virtues.');
  d(config.textcolor,'They believe in good and should be played that way for best');
  d(config.textcolor,'results. Paladins are strong and skilled in combat. They');
  d(config.textcolor,'also possess a special attack : the soulstrike. Paladins');
  d(config.textcolor,'receive an extra bonus in Stamina per experience level.');
  pause;
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Ranger');
  d(config.textcolor,'Rangers are great survivors, because they must depend on their');
  d(config.textcolor,'ability to live off the land. Like Bards, they have many special');
  d(config.textcolor,'abilities, though they do not excel at any particular one. Their');
  d(config.textcolor,'fighting and healing powers are among their best abilities.');
  d(config.textcolor,'Rangers receive an extra bonus in Wisdom per experience level.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Sage');
  d(config.textcolor,'The weakest combat-class is the Sage. His hand-to-hand abilities');
  d(config.textcolor,'leave much to be desired, but as the Sage grows in experience,');
  d(config.textcolor,'his spell casting abilities can dominate any class, mortal or');
  d(config.textcolor,'divine. Sages receive an extra bonus in Wisdom per');
  d(config.textcolor,'experience level.');
  crlf;
  d(5,'The Warrior');
  d(config.textcolor,'Warriors are excellent killers. Their extraordinary combat');
  d(config.textcolor,'ability makes them difficult opponents. Though their class has');
  d(config.textcolor,'no extra abilities, there are no extra penalties levied against');
  d(config.textcolor,'them either. Fighters receive an extra bonus in Stamina per');
  d(config.textcolor,'experience level.');

  d(config.textcolor,'that he is secretly building his own empire somewhere on the great');
